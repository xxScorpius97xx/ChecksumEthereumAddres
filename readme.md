The Ethereum address checksum mechanism is regulated by Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 55. This proposal introduced checksummed addresses, which include both capital and lowercase letters. 

**Example:**

**Original address: 0x12ae66cdc592e10b60f9097a7b0d3c59fce29876**

**Checksummed address: 0x12AE66CDc592e10B60f9097a7b0D3C59fce29876**

When transmitting or receiving cryptocurrency, this mix of capital and lowercase letters adds an extra layer of mistake detection, reducing the risk of inadvertent errors during transactions. 

So, to ensure transaction accuracy and guard against the loss of funds due to human error, it’s essential to use Ethereum addresses in their checksummed version.
